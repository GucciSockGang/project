        <p>I am a High School student from the east coast, new to the world of coding.  I spend most of my time being a student, but in my free time I focused on working on my computer and improving my skills as a Fire Fighter. Another hobby I have is playing airsoft. I created this website to showcase my skill in html brackets.</p>
